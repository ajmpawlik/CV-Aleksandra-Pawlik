I am an early career full-stack software developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy. I am building on my experience in research for international development. I managed, designed and consulted on multiple evaluations - in Afghanistan and in the multi-country settings. I provided actionable and human-centred insights for the implementers and clients. I am qualitative and quantitative research methods savvy with a background in anthropology, media, and economics.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker and creative problem solver  
During my time

#### Curious and passionate technology.

#### Avid, fast and independent learner

Curiosity, thirst for understanding, and a desire for intellectual growth are at the very core of guiding principles that lead me to explore anthropology, media, and economics in the academic settings. I have always been interested in practical applications of the knowledge I gained and confronted it with the reality, working as a researcher/monitoring and evaluation consultant - drawing from the skillset of anthropologist and economist, as well as in radio and print applying the tools of journalistic trade.

I have never shied from a challenge, and experienced learning from scratch "on the job". During my time in Rosenstock Legal Services, the American law firm based in Kabul, Afghanistan, I have been entrusted with managing company's financial and administrative activities including client relations regarding invoicing, managing tax payments and payroll. Thanks to this experience I learnt how to manage the back office of a company functioning in a multicultural setting, in a volatile environment, as well as how to run finance department according to the Afghan law. While starting without any prior experience, within the first quarter I implemented an improved accounting system, and as a result, had been promoted to the position of Head of Finance and Administration.  

#### Great collaborator and team-builder
I thrive working in the teams. I used to work in various set-ups:
* during my time at Makers I have been a member of the self-organising teams working following the agile principles. It was a great opportunity to learn, develop functioning applications and solutions, and most importantly create great working culture. With my colleagues we captured the spirit of teamwork on the two vlog channels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyjI074rbqE"> Forest programming language development </a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fr4jZW9YTg&feature=youtu.be"> the work on the Rails project</a>.
* while working an independent evaluator subcontracting for the London based Coffey International Development I have been in charge of operations
